This is an iOS application written in swift 3 for connecting to a bluetooth device. You can then adjust a slider which sends a value between 0 and 100 to the connected device. It is a modified version of https://github.com/nebs/hello-bluetooth.

You will need to change the service id to the service id of the peripheral deivce you want to connect to. After that it should work without any changes to the code.

The app tries to connect immediatly after booting, so make sure that your peripheral device is already on when you start it.
